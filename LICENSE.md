# BuildCraft API
LiquidEnergy includes the Buildcraft API, which is licensed under the MMPL v1 - Sources are available at [SirSengirs GitHub](https://github.com/SirSengir/BuildCraft) and the mods site is at [mod-buildcraft.com](http://www.mod-buildcraft.com). LiquidEnergy uses the buildcraft.api.* package.

# IC2 API
While I could not find a 'license' as such, this mod will fully comply with the terms set out on the [IC2 Forums](http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=344). This mod is not solely basing off of IC2, so will not necessarily be hosted on Industrial-Craft servers. So far there is no forum thread for this, however there will be one as necessary on the IC forums when completed.
