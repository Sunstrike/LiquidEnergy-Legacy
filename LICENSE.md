#`io.sunstrike.mods.liquidenergy.external`
LiquidEnergy includes certain utility classes from other mods. A list is provided below along with license-mandated links and information.

* buildcraft.core.render.TextureLiquidsFX - From [BuildCraft](http://www.mod-buildcraft.com)[(GitHub)](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft). Sources are unmodified save for the package clause, as such the whole mod shouldn't require licensing under MMPLv1 (if this is incorrect, please report it to the maintainer at <[sunstrike@azurenode.net](mailto:sunstrike@azurenode.net)> immediately).

# BuildCraft API
LiquidEnergy includes the Buildcraft API, which is licensed under the MMPL v1 - Sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft) and the mods site is at [mod-buildcraft.com](http://www.mod-buildcraft.com). LiquidEnergy uses the buildcraft.api.* package.

# IC2 API
While I could not find a 'license' as such, this mod will fully comply with the terms set out on the [IC2 Forums](http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=344). This mod is not solely basing off of IC2, so will not necessarily be hosted on Industrial-Craft servers. So far there is no forum thread for this, however there will be one as necessary on the IC forums when completed.
